      subsidiary of BMW AG since 2003
      as the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce-branded motor cars.
      The company's line of vehicles includes the Phantom, a four-door saloon first offered in 2003 as well as its
      extended wheelbase two-door coupé and convertible variants; the smaller Ghost four-door saloon; Wraith two-door
      coupe; Dawn convertible; the Cullinan SUV, and the forthcoming 2023 Spectre,
      <br><br>he first all-electric Rolls-Royce. In 1998, Vickers decided to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. The most likely
      buyer was BMW, which already supplied engines and other components for Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, but BMW's
      final offer of £340 million was beaten by Volkswagen's £430 million ($703 million).
